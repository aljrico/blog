This week I started studying Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics with Python. As many, I use Conda for managing my Python environments and packages. On this post I will cover how to create new environments on Conda and how to use them with JupyterLab.

There are a lot of technical reasons to use (virtual) environments, but to keep this entry short and simple, an environment acts as a sandbox for all your packages and dependencies. This is very useful when you have different projects that require different dependencies or versions of certain packages.

Note: for this post I will use `nlp-compling` as the environment name in all my examples.

## Create a new Conda environment

Creating a new environment is a straightforward process:

```bash
conda create --name nlp-compling
```

This creates the `nlp-compling` environment in `/envs` directory on your Anaconda root directory. This environment uses the same version of Python of your base environment.

To create an environment with a specific version of Python:
```bash
conda create --name nlp-compling python=3.6
```

More details and options for creating environments can be found on [Conda Documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

## Using environments on Conda

Whenever you need to use your environment on the terminal, you need to activate it first:
```bash
source activate nlp-compling
```

After activating the environment, your terminal should looks something like this:

{% include image.html lightbox="false" src="jupyter-env-terminal.png" data="group" title="Image title" width="auto" %}

This means all operations performed with `conda` (such as installing, updating, or removing packages) will only affect that environment.

To go back to the base Conda environment, just type:
```bash
source deactivate
```
Note that you don't need to deactivate your current environment to switch to another one.

If you are done with a project, or for whatever reason you wish to delete the environment, you can do it by just typing:
```bash
conda remove --name nlp-compling --all
```

## Use the new environment as a Jupyter kernel

To be able to use the newly created environment on JupyterLab, we need to install the following packages on the environment:
```bash
source activate nlp-compling
conda install jupyter nb_conda nb_conda_kernels
```

After this, we need to set up the environment as an IPython/Jupyter kernel:
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name nlp-compling --display-name "NLP+CompLing"
```
Note that the `--display-name` argument is optional. More information on this step can be found on [IPython Documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments).

Now, if we head to JupyterLab, we'll see our environment as an option for creating new Notebooks and Consoles:

{% include image.html lightbox="false" src="jupyter-kernels.png" data="group" title="Image title" width="100%" %}

If, for any reason, you need to modify the properties of the kernel, just modify the `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/nlp-compling/kernel.json` config file. It should look like this:

```json
{
 "argv": [
  "~/.anaconda3/envs/nlp-compling/bin/python",
  "-m",
  "ipykernel_launcher",
  "-f",
  "{connection_file}"
 ],
 "display_name": "NLP+CompLing",
 "language": "python"
}
```
