Hi there! I'm Alfredo. I am a Physicist finding a path in Data Science. I have a passion for technology, maths, and design. I've collaborated on several Open Source projects, especially those related to the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/aldomann" target="_blank">Ubuntu Community</a>.

One of the things I really enjoy doing in my daily life is programming. You can find all my projects on my <a href="http://github.com/aldomann" target="_blank">Github</a> profile.

### Why a blog?

One of the things that made me create this blog is the feedback from the GNOME community about some of my mockups (originally published on <a href="https://aldomann.deviantart.com/gallery/45668852/Mockups" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a>) whenever I would publish one on <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/116790799251153536343" target="_blank">GNOME Design</a>'s Google+ community. But what really pushed me to do it was <a href="https://plus.google.com/+BilalElMoussaoui" target="_blank">Bilal Elmoussaoui</a>'s work on one of my mockups: Audio Cutter.

So my idea is to start publishing my mockups here, either additionally or only here (I still have to decide it).

One of the things I also want to write about here is Linux in general and updates about the book I'm writing about $$ \LaTeX $$: [The Alf Way to LaTeX]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-27-the-alf-way-to-latex %}).
